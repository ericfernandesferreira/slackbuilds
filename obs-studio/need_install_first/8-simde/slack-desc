# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

simde: The SIMDe header-only library provides fast, portable implementations
simde: of SIMD intrinsics on hardware which doesn't natively support them,
simde: such as calling SSE functions on ARM. There is no performance penalty
simde: if the hardware supports the native implementation (e.g., SSE/AVX runs
simde: at full speed on x86, NEON on ARM, etc.).
