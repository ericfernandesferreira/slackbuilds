# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

botan3: Botanâ€™s goal is to be the best option for production cryptography by
botan3: offering the tools necessary to implement a range of practical systems,
botan3: such as TLSv1.3, X.509 PKI, modern AEAD ciphers, support for PKCS#11
botan3: and TPM hardware, memory-hard password hashing, and post quantum
botan3: cryptography. All of this is covered by an extensive test suite,
botan3: including an automated system for detecting side channels.
