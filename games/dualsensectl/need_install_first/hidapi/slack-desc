# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

hidapi: HIDAPI is a multi-platform library which allows an application to
hidapi: interface with USB and Bluetooth HID-Class devices on Windows, Linux,
hidapi: FreeBSD, and macOS. HIDAPI can be either built as a shared library
hidapi: (.so, .dll or .dylib) or can be embedded directly into a target
hidapi: application by adding a single source file (per platform) and a single
hidapi: header.
