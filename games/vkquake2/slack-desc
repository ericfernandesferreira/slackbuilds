# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

vkquake2: This is the official Quake 2 code v3.21 with Vulkan support and mission
vkquake2: packs included. The goal of this project is to maintain as much
vkquake2: compatibility as possible with the original game - just pure, vanilla
vkquake2: Quake 2 experience as we knew it back in 1997.
