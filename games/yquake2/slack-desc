# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

yquake2: Yamagi Quake II is an enhanced client for id Software's Quake II with
yquake2: focus on offline and coop gameplay. Both the gameplay and the graphics
yquake2: are unchanged, but many bugs in the last official release were fixed
yquake2: and some nice to have features like widescreen support and a modern
yquake2: OpenGL 3.2 renderer were added.
