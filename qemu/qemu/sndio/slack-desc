# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

sndio: Sndio is a small audio and MIDI framework part of the OpenBSD project
sndio: and ported to FreeBSD, Linux and NetBSD. It provides a lightweight
sndio: audio & MIDI server and a fully documented user-space API to access
sndio: either the server or the hardware directly in a uniform way. Sndio is
sndio: designed to work for desktop applications, but pays special attention
sndio: to synchronization mechanisms and reliability equired by music
sndio: applications. Reliability through simplicity are part of the project
sndio: goals.
